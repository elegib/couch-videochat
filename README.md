COUCH
Couch is an app that wants to host authentic hangouts


Couches

Enjoy the conversation by making the most of it! You can keep a single big group to gather everyone together or create smaller couches for the latest private updates.
Switch couches, join another group of friends or create a brand new couch: there’s no limit to your conversation!


Speak out loud

Make that big announcement you have been dying to do. Say it. To everyone! Even if you are in a couch you can still speak out loud and everyone will hear you, you just need to press a button and the job is done! 



Whisper

Or maybe you miss whispering funny jokes to few people, share that little secret with someone without anybody else knowing about it. Record a voice message and send it to your partner in crime, your secret will be safe!


Ephemeral Chat

Share all the content you’d like, interesting links, photos, show your friends the funniest meme and laugh all together! The ephemeral chat works as a series of shared content: save the ones you like and let the others go! 



Broadcast

Share even more! Use the broadcast function to stream content with all your friends. You can either access the integrated app or mirror your screen and enjoy the streaming with your friends!



Hear better

Hear it all and hear it good! The smart audio algorythm turns your conversations in lifelike experiences. You’ll be able to clearly hear everything, listen to people talking together and you’ll catch any single comment.
